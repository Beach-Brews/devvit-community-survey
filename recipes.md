## Ideas/Suggestions by community
* ~~Karma (account and/or community) minimums for survey AND possibly question level~~
* ~~Settings for Approved Users or User Flairs as well as Karma + email verified~~
* ~~Option for mod-only responses~~
* Discuss if there is a way to build in bot-bouncer checks (i.e. read wiki?)
* ~~The APIs calls do not check for guest/banned users~~
* Add trigger to detect user bans immediately

## Future Features

Here are a few future features that are planned.

### General
* Text field support
  * Text response comments: anonymously posted or posted as user
  * If the app comments something, and it is removed (or flagged by Reddit filters), the app is likely to be banned? How can I avoid this?

### Dashboard
* Survey list filter / pagination
* ~~Date selector for publish and close dates~~
* Update notice + release notes from wiki page?

  * Save default settings for future surveys
  * Add Flair to Survey Post
  * ~~Result visibility~~

    * ~~Only once closed~~
    * ~~Mods only~~
* Survey Question Settings
  * Required
  * Randomize question options
* Import/Export/Backup?
* Auth-Token Timeout Modal/Message
* Duplicate/Copy survey
* Rolling/Repeating survey?
* Handle cross-device/multi-tab editing. Channels? Lock?
* Link to survey post
* View live survey config (settings, questions, etc.)
  * Possibly allow some editing? (e.g. question description or label)

### Survey

### Know Issues

**Dashboard**

* Bug: Editing surveys on two separate devices at the same time
* Bug: If survey list is scrolled, the editor also starts already scrolled, which cuts off the setting tabs.

**Survey Posts**

* Bug: Question description - The show description link does not appear when question title is too long and wraps to a second line
