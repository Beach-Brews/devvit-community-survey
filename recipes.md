## Ideas/Suggestions by community
* ~~Karma (account and/or community) minimums for survey AND possibly question level~~
* ~~Settings for Approved Users or User Flairs as well as Karma + email verified~~
* ~~Option for mod-only responses~~
* Discuss if there is a way to build in bot-bouncer checks (i.e. read wiki?)
* ~~The APIs calls do not check for guest/banned users~~
* Add trigger to detect user bans immediately
