# Community Survey

Introducing the Community Survey app for Reddit! A way to provide more advanced polls and surveys directly in Reddit without having to use an external survey provider (such as Google Forms or Survey Monkey). This app ensures confidence and control for both the survey author and responders!

Moderators are able to create surveys, schedule publish and/or close dates, and view aggregated results. Published surveys appear directly the user's feed, allowing them to respond and view results without having to leave Reddit. This not only helps increase user engagement, but also allows the survey author to choose user account criteria to ensure accurate results for the target audience (i.e. no banned users or newly created accounts).

**Question Types**
* Multiple Choice (One Selection)
* Checkbox (Multiple Selection)
* Rank (Order Options Highest to Lowest)
* Scale (1-5 or 1-10)
* _More Coming Soon!_

Currently, all user responses are anonymously aggregated. Mods do not have the ability to see individual user responses. However, an "application" mode is planned for a future release. Users may delete their response at any time, even after the survey has been closed.

## Ongoing Development

Community Survey is still undergoing development and is currently in an Alpha phase. Please note there are likely glitches. There are also a large number of features planned for future releases.

## Terms of Use + Privacy Policy

Please review the Community Survey [Terms of Use and Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommunitySurvey/wiki/app/terms-and-privacy/).

**All user response data remains within Reddit. This app does not track/retain user data** (except what is required for app functionality, such as userID for response editing/deleting).
