## Introduction

Introducing the Community Survey app for Reddit! A way to provide more advanced polls and surveys directly in Reddit without having to use an external survey provider (such as Google Forms or Survey Monkey). This app ensures confidence and control for both the survey author and responders!

Moderators are able to create surveys, schedule publish and/or close dates, choose responder criteria, when and who can see results, and view the aggregated responses. Published surveys appear directly in the user's feed, allowing them to respond and view results without having to leave Reddit. This not only helps increase user engagement, but also allows the survey author to choose user account criteria to ensure accurate results for the target audience (e.g. users with a minimum subreddit karma or account age).

Currently, all user responses are anonymously aggregated. Mods do not have the ability to see individual user responses. However, an "application" mode is planned for a future release. Users may delete their response at any time, even after the survey has been closed.

## Ongoing Development

Community Survey is still in development and is labeled as Alpha because some features are still being developed. There are also a large number of additional features planned for future releases.  Please visit [r/CommunitySurvey](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommunitySurvey) to report any bugs or make feature requests.

## Terms of Use + Privacy Policy

Please review the Community Survey [Terms of Use and Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommunitySurvey/wiki/app/terms-and-privacy/).

**All user response data remains within Reddit. This app does not track/retain user data** (except what is required for app functionality, such as userID for response editing/deleting).
