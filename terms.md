## Privacy Policy

### 1. Overview

This Privacy Policy explains how this application (“the App”) handles information when you use it on the Reddit platform. The App operates entirely within Reddit’s developer environment ("Devvit") and relies on Reddit’s systems for data storage, authentication, and permissions.

By using the App, you acknowledge that your interactions are also governed by **Reddit’s [Rules](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules), [Public Content Policy](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/26410290525844-Public-Content-Policy), and [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy)**, which remain the primary documents controlling your data on the platform. **This Privacy Policy does not replace or supersede Reddit’s terms in any way.**

### 2. Information We Collect

#### 2.1 Information You Provide Through Reddit

The App does **not** request or collect any personal information beyond what Reddit already provides to applications through its standard APIs. Depending on the App’s functionality, this may include:

- Your Reddit username and/or user ID (as provided by Reddit when required for functionality)
- Actions you take within the App (e.g., submitting a survey response, voting in a poll, interacting with features)

The App itself **does not** collect or store any additional personal data such as email addresses, real names, IP addresses, demographic information, or any other identifying information.

#### 2.2 No Direct Personal Data Collection

This App does **not** knowingly collect, process, or store any personal data outside of Reddit’s platform. All data is handled through the Reddit platform using the permissions you approve.  
**No external databases, servers, or third-party services are used.**

### 3. How Data Is Stored and Used

#### 3.1 Storage

All App data is stored using Reddit’s infrastructure (via Devvit and Reddit-provided storage systems).  
No data is stored off-platform.

#### 3.2 Usage

Information is used only to enable the App’s features — for example:

- Managing in-App interactions
- Storing your survey responses or votes
- Displaying aggregated or anonymized results (unless survey anonymous mode is off)

The App never sells, leases, or shares data to third parties.

### 4. Data Retention

Data is retained only as long as necessary for the App’s intended functionality or as long as Reddit retains it through its platform systems. Users may remove App-related data by deleting their interactions where Reddit allows it.

### 5. Data Security

This App relies on **Reddit’s platform security measures**. As no data leaves Reddit’s environment, the App does not provide additional independent security systems.

### 6. Children’s Privacy

This App does not target or knowingly collect information from individuals under the age of 13. Users must follow Reddit’s age restrictions.

### 7. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Changes will be reflected in the “Last Updated” date above.
